# PROJECT: SPACE SHOOTER

_Expand your knowledge and experience of working with Unity by creating a simple
top down arcade style shooter. Using basic assets provided by Unity
Technologies, built-in components and writing simple custom code, understand
how to work with imported Mesh Models, Audio, Textures and Materials while
practicing more complicated Scripting principles._

This is the result of one of Unity3D official tutorials that can be found in
the website, [Space
Shooter](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter).
